I used my java program to decode the cipher text using a transposition cipher. I filled a 2D array with the cipher text, row-wise, spanning 4, 5, then 6 columns (per iteration of the loop). For each iteration, I read out the columns from right to left (reverse order) to get the original plaintext. I checked if the decoded text was in tess26.txt. If it was, I set the decoded text. If it was not, I continued to the next iteration (using 4,5,6 columns respectively). Once the decoded text was found, I set it as the decoded text in my java program and wrote it to the output file.
