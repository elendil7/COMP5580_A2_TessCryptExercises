I used the Vigenere cipher decryption method to decode the cipher text using the key I found in my java program. The vignere key was not given in the exercise, so I had to find it. I divided the cipher text into 4, 5, and 6 groups respectively using the modulo operator, then found the character frequencies for each group respectively. I then found the key by comparing the character frequencies to the English language character frequencies, determining the optimal shift for each group. Using the newfound keys, I decoded the ciphertext in the same way as exercise 2, by decrypting the ciphertext with keys of length (4,5,6) respectively. Once the decoded text was found (by comparing the decoded output to the tess26 plaintext file), I set it as the decoded text in my java program and wrote it to the output file.
